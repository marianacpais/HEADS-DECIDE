## Part 2

**Decision analysis** is
– A quantitative and systematic approach
– allowing us to formalize, model and quantitatively analyse the decision-making process
– aiming to compare the relative benefits, risks, outcomes and values associated with different decision alternatives and
– the consideration, evaluation and modelling of several sources of uncertainty and heterogeneity affecting the decision-making process

– Decisions about individual patients
– Development of protocols and guidelines
– Decisions about healthcare technologies
– Management and administrative decisions
– Healthcare policy decisions

•The Probability Rule
•The Order Rule
•The Equivalence Rule
•The Substitution Rule
•The Choice Rule

A lottery is a probability function from a set of states S of the world into a set X of possible prizes

Decision Models
- Normative models
  - Decision Trees
  - Influence Diagrams
  - Bayesian/Belief Networks
  - Markov Models
- Descriptive models
  - Fallacies and biases in human decision making and judgment
  - Prospect theory (Tversky and Kahnemann)

Decision Analysis – Operational Stages
1 – Identification, clarification and simplification of the decision problem, clear definition of the decision context and stakeholders, systematic identification of the decision alternatives and the main factors and components relevant for the problem
2 – Structuring, formalizing and representing the decision problem using appropriate tools and methods (e.g.: Decision Trees, Influence Diagrams, Bayesian/Belief Networks, Markov Models, etc.) and taking into account the most relevant events, factors and components of the decision problem
3 – Definition of events and factors between the alternatives and outcomes
4 – Definition of all possible outcomes, outcome variables and valuation of each possible outcome
5 – Finding adequate evidence to support the estimates of the parameters of the model and expressing the uncertainty of those estimates, by systematically reviewing the scientific evidence or discussing with expertsDecision Analysis
6 – Prepare the final representation of the model (e.g. a Decision Tree) and apply the appropriate principles and quantitative methods to find the best alternative for the decision problem
7 – Assess and explore the various sources of uncertainty in the model using appropriate methods (e.g. sensitivity analysis, simulation, statistic modelling, etc.)

Decision Tree
- The decision tree has nodes, branches and outcomes
- There are two types of nodes:
  - Decision node
    - Decision nodes are represented by squares and usually are at the beginning of the tree and define all the alternatives in the decision problem
  - Probability node
    - Probability nodes are represented by circles and define the relevant events between alternatives and outcomes and the respective probabilities for each possible branch

The outcomes, utilities or payoffs at the end of each path are represented by terminal nodes in the form of triangles or rectangles at the right side of the decision tree

Analysing and solving the decision tree
– The analysis of the decision tree will follow the principle of maximization of expected utility (or minimization of expected disutility)
– The calculations throughout the process are based on the rules of multiplication and summation of probabilities and on the Bayes’ theorem and assume the conditional independence of events
– The calculations will estimate the probability of each path (folding back); and this will weight the outcome, payoff, utility or disutility associated with that path


Sensitivity analysis is a method where the robustness of the
estimates of parameters is assessed using simulation and modelling
techniques

There are five essential sources of variability and potential uncertainty
that should be taken into account, assessed and explored no in the
context of any decision analytic model:
1. Variability and uncertainty associated with the **model structure and assumptions**
2. Variability associated with the **uncertainty affecting the model** parameters
3. Variability associated with the **stochastic nature of events** and outcomes/utilities in the target population
4. Variability associated with the **heterogeneity in the target population**
5. Variability associated with the **existence of subgroups** in the target population

Sensitivity analysis can take the form of univariate (in which uncertainty associated with the value of one input parameter is explored), multivariate (in which the combined uncertainty associated with two or more parameters is explored) or probabilistic sensitivity analysis (in which the combined uncertainty of all model parameters is explored).

Markov Models
- Markov chains (discrete time, stationary when TP are constant in all cycles)
- Markov processes (continuous time)

Cost-Minimisation Analysis
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis -
Cost-Benefit Analysis
Cost-Utility Analysis


Whereas cost-effectiveness analysis uses natural, programme-specific, measures of effect such as symptom-free day, cost-utility analysis uses quality-adjusted measures of effect, for example Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY), Health-Adjusted Life Years (HALY) or Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY). Many authors either make no distinction between cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis or argue that cost-utility analysis is a subtype of cost-effectiveness analysis.


As this situation commonly accompanies innovation in healthcare, the results of cost-effectiveness analysis are often expressed using an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). The ICER represents the ratio of the difference in costs between interventions, to the difference in effectiveness between interventions.
