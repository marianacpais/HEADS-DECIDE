# Lesson 04 - Real-world data studies

## Introduction

**Real World Data Studies**

- No consensual definition. Typically understood as studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions in “real clinical practice”;
- Aim to overcome some of the limitations of classical clinical trials: Diverse populations, wider set of assessed clinical settings, wider range of assessed outcomes...
- Can be observational/non-interventional or interventional/pragmatic

- **Common data sources**: electronic health records, administrative datasets, patient registries...
- Problems with unmeasured confounders and data quality or missing information (particularly in retrospective studies)


## Explanatory versus pragmatic trials

Assessing the nature of the trial based on a set of dichotomous questions:

Proposed criteria to distinguish effectiveness from efficacy trials

Item 1 Populations in primary care
Item 2 Less stringent eligibility criteria
Item 3 Health outcomes
Item 4 Long study duration; clinically relevant treatment modalities
Item 5 Assessment of adverse events
Item 6 Adequate sample size to assess a minimally important difference from a patient perspective
Item 7 ITT analysis

Gartlehneret G al. J Clin Epidemiol. 2006

### Item 1 Populations in primary care

“For effectiveness trials, settings should reflect the initial care facilities available to a diverse population with the condition of interest.”
“Efficacy studies are frequently conducted in large tertiary care, referral setting.” -> more specialized clinicians, better equipment, selection biases...

### Item 2 Less stringent eligibility criteria

“For effectiveness trials, eligibility criteria must allow the source population to reflect the heterogeneity of external populations: the full spectrum of the human population, their comorbidities, variable compliance rates, and use of other medications [...].Comorbidities and other medications cannot be general exclusion criteria unless they contraindicate the use of the agent in ordinary practice.”

### Item 3 Health outcomes

“Health outcomes [((e.g., functional capacity, quality of life, mortality)], relevant to the condition of interest, should be the principal outcome measures in effectiveness studies” instead of surrogate markers.

### Item 4 Long study duration; clinically relevant treatment modalities

“In effectiveness trials, study durations should mimic a minimum length of treatment in a clinical setting to allow the assessment of health outcomes.”
“In effectiveness trials, [...] investigators should define compliance as an outcome measure” (and not enforce it).

### Item 5 Assessment of adverse events

“Effectiveness studies use objective scales with predefined symptoms [(e.g., World Health Organization scale of adverse reactions)] to determine adverse events rates.” (and not enforce it).

### Item 6 Adequate sample size to assess a minimally important difference from a patient perspective

“The sample size of an effectiveness trial should be sufficient to detect at least a minimally important difference on a health-related quality of life scale. For conditions where rare but significant outcomes such as mortality or hospitalizations are of main interest, sample sizes must be greater and based on adequate power calculations.

### Item 7 ITT analysis

Intention-to-treat analysis

### Assessing the nature of the trial based on a pragmatic-explanatory continuum

## Direct Patient Data

- Correspond to data directly provided by patients about their health;
- Allow for an assessment of patients “in their natural state”;
- Often allow for the obtention of large data volumes or of frequent data by patient;
- Retrieval made easier by digital health tools (e.g., mHealth tools)

**Infodemiology studies**
- Assessment of the distribution and determinants of the information in the electronic medium (namely the Internet) to inform health decision and policy.
- Infodemiology studies –“supply” studies vs “demand-side” studies

**Main subjects:**
- <u>Relative search volumes (e.g., Google Trends)</u>
- Prevalence, incidence and quality of available online information
- Quantity and quality of health apps
- <u>Social media/microblogging posts: Quantity, content and sentiment</u>
- News coverage (e.g., MediaCloud): Quantity, content and sentiment
